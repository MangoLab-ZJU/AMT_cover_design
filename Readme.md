## Cover Description (57 words):

This cover depicts a highly sensitive and cost-effective magnetic levitation (Maglev)-based physical sensing method for reliable, real-time monitoring of elastomer crosslinking, crucial for deep-sea soft robots' performance and manufacturing quality. This method is the first demonstration of high-precision polymer curing monitoring based on physical property sensing rather than chemical analysis, representing a novel in situ quantification strategy.
